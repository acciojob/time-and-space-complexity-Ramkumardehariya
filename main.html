	<h1>Time, space, and complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures an algorithm's efficiency by indicating how its runtime grows with input size, helping design faster, efficient solutions.</p>
	<p> <b>Space complexity </b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses. If it's O(n), memory grows linearly with input size.</p>
